*******User Interface:

Create a user interface using HTML and CSS to allow users to input the limit expression they want to evaluate.
Design the user interface with appropriate input fields, buttons, and result display areas.
Backend Logic:

********Set up a Flask server to handle incoming requests and serve the HTML templates.
Define routes to handle different URLs, such as the homepage and form submission.
When the user submits the form, the server will receive the input data.
Processing the Limit Expression:

********Extract the limit expression entered by the user from the form submission data.
Use SymPy  to evaluate the limit expression and calculate the result.
Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the evaluation process.
Returning the Result:

**********Pass the calculated result back to the Flask server.
Render a result page using an HTML template and pass the result to it.
Display the result on the result page for the user to see.
User Experience:

************Consider implementing error handling and validation to ensure proper input and provide informative error messages if needed.
Enhance the user experience by adding features like clearing the input fields or allowing the user to perform multiple limit calculations without refreshing the page.
Apply appropriate CSS styles to make the user interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
Testing and Debugging:

****************Test the limit calculator thoroughly by entering different limit expressions and verifying that the results are accurate.
Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing and fix them to ensure the calculator functions correctly.
